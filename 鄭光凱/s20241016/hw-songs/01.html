            If you climb the highest mountain<br>
            Cross the river deep<br>
            Maybe you'll find it's never as easy<br>
            As it first appears — as it first appears<br>
            Just remember not to worry<br>
            Or get down at heart<br>
            Never lose faith in positive thinking<br>
            You'll be amazed when you achieve<br>
            All the things you start — all the things you start<br>
            So never, never, never give up even though the going's tough<br>
            Don't stop trying, when you're tiring, and you're out of puff<br>
            No never, never, never give up even though you're feeling rough<br>
            If at first you don't succeed — never, never, never give up<br>
            If at first you don't succeed<br>
            Then try and try again<br>
            Nothing in life is ever as easy<br>
            But you get there in the end — get there in the end<br>
            So blow your cares and woes behind you<br>
            Start a brand new day<br>
            Nothing can stop you reaching your goal<br>
            If you're determined — you can do it<br>
            You will find a way — you will find a way<br>
            So never, never, never give up even though the going's tough<br>
            Don't stop trying, when you're tiring, and you're out of puff<br>
            No never, never, never give up even though you're feeling rough<br>
            If at first you don't succeed — never, never, never give up<br>
            Some things seem impossible, answers hard to find<br>
            No matter how improbable, you won't know until you try<br>
            You can do — whatever you choose — it just takes a little luck<br>
            So remember never, never, never give up<br>
            Never, never, never give up even though the going's tough<br>
            Don't stop trying, when you're tiring, and you're out of puff<br>
            No never, never, never give up even though you're feeling rough<br>
            If at first you don't succeed — never, never, never give up<br>
            Never, never, never give up even though the going's tough<br>
            Don't stop trying, when you're tiring, and you're out of puff<br>
            No never, never, never give up even though you're feeling rough<br>
            If at first you don't succeed — never, never, never give up<br>
            Never, never, never give up<br>
